## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework


### What I learned

I used this challenge as an introductory to Next.js and Tailwindcss to improve my understanding of theses frameworks outside of tutorials. I wanted to ensure that I could create a working site with Next.js and easily incorporate Tailwindcss, allowing me to create simple, clean repsonsive sites very quickly. 

- Installation of Tailwindcss with Next.js
- Custom Document with Next.js


### Continued development

Next.js is a natural progression from my experience with React, therefore I plan on continue to improve my knowledge and experience with this framework and applying it to future projects. 


### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Their documentation is very easy to follow and simple instructions when understanding each of the utility clases.
